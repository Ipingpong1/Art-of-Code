Image made by simulating Schrodinger Equation on a double-slit experiment setup. This image represents how the probability distribution of a photon looks like right when it hits the slits. The image to me represents a piece of art where all possible interpretations are correct. To say that we know exactly what this equation is visually telling us is to claim to understand the most funamental aspect of reality. To see patterns in it however is to look up to the clouds and find beauty in something much larger than ourselves.

Drawing made using GridCalc, a program I wrote to map points on a refrence image to an arbitrarily sized canvas. Represents mathematically perfect proportions carried out using physically imperfect hands.
